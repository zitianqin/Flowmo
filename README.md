# Flowmo
Flowmo is an online Flowtime timer that includes a focus timer, task list, and rest timer.

## Features
- Focus Timer: A stopwatch to track the amount of time spent working.
- Task List: A locally-stored list to manage your tasks during your focus session.
- Rest Timer: A timer to manage your break times.

## Usage
1. Start the focus timer and work on a task for as long as you need to.
2. Stop the timer and take a break as soon as you start feeling fatigued or if you start to lose concentration.
3. Break times generally last one-fifth of your working time, but can be adjusted. For example, if you work for 50 minutes, you should take a 10 minute break.

## Inspiration for the Project
### Motivation
One of the disadvantages of the pomodoro technique is that the timer consistently interrupts you, preventing you from fully immersing yourself into a task. Flowtime is a time management technique that does not interrupt you during a focus session, allowing you to fully concentrate on the task at hand.

Not many flowtime timers exist, and those that do typically require users to create an account or pay a fee. Flowmo seeks to provide a free, accessible, and user-friendly solution for anyone seeking to improve their productivity and focus using the Flowtime technique. Flowmo has the bare essentials for a focus session, including a focus timer, task list, and rest timer. By focusing on core functionality and eliminating unnecessary features, we have removed all distractions, allowing you to concentrate better.

### Future Developments
- Integration with Google Calendar and Tasks
- Option to play binaural beats when focusing
- Option to play non-sleep deep rest audio files to play when resting
- Light mode
