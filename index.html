      <h1>An Online Flowtime Timer — Right in Your Browser</h1>
      <h2>What is Flowtime?</h2>
      <p>Flowtime is a time management technique where a stopwatch is used to track the amount of time spent working. You work on a task for as long as you need to, stopping the timer and taking a break as soon as you start feeling fatigued or if you start to lose concentration.</p>
      <p>Break times generally last one-fifth of your working time, but can be adjusted. For example, if you work for 50 minutes, you should take a 10 minute break.</p>
      <h2>Why not Pomodoro?</h2>
      <p>One of the disadvantages of the pomodoro technique is that the timer consistently interrupts you, preventing you from fully immersing yourself into a task.</p>
      <p>Flowtime, on the other hand, does not interrupt you during a focus session, allowing you to fully concentrate on the task at hand.</p>
